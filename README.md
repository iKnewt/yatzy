# yatzy
Another school project

The assignment is as follows:

Make the game of Yatzy (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (Yahtzee).

    As a start, make it for one person (You can expand it to accept more players if you want).
    You can choose if you make it "forced" or "open" (start with Forced).
        Forced = you have to follow the scoreboard from top to bottom. This is the easiest.
        Open = the player can choose what row she want to put her dice. This is harder.
    You have to make a function that gives the sum of ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes in your dice.
    For combinations in the lower section, make one function for each row, to calculate if the dice holds a match, and what the value of the dice is.
    You must have an array to hold all the rows of the score board.
        Make a function that writes this score board to screen.

    Optional 1: Make it so the player is asked at the start of the program to play with "forced" or "open" rules, as explained above.
    Optional 2: If this is easy / quick, you can start to make an AI to play against.
    Optional 3: As stated previously, you can make the game for more than one human player.
    Optional 4: If you are used to classes by now, you should use classes for parts of this game. If not, just make use of functions. You probably should at least use a struct!
